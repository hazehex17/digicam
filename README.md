This project is a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W powered digital camera with a 4'' LCD display. You're able to turn on and off the camera, take pictures, and switch modes (between Camera Mode and Gallery Mode) so you can look at previous pictures you've taken. A USB port on the side of the camera lets you transfer images to another device, like your computer, so you can look back on them in the future!
I decided to build a camera because I thought that it would be a really cool project to build! I have always wondered how a camera works, and I get to learn how to build one through Blueprint. The images, albeit low-quality compared to a smartphone,  give a uniquely nostalgic feel and prevents you from getting distracted by other features on your phone - you can live in the moment.
Camera features:
-> 4'' LCD display panel
-> shutter release button on top of the camera, push buttons for on/off switch, mode, and scroll buttons in Gallery
-> Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W single-board computer and Pi Camera Module V3 lens and Zero Camera cable
-> custom 3D-printed case to cover the Pi board, part of the LCD display panel, and the camera cable
